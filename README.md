JS in the Browser: DOM Manipulation and Events

- The Pig Game

## Personal Documentation

- The floor() method rounds a number DOWNWARDS to the nearest integer, and returns the result.
If the passed argument is an integer, the value will not be rounded.

- Type coercion is the process of converting value from one type to another (such as string to number, object to boolean, and so on).

- HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.	When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.

-	A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.Example in the eventListener, or check MDN website.

- An anonymous function is a function that was declared without any named identifier to refer to it. As such, an anonymous function is usually not accessible after its initial creation.
